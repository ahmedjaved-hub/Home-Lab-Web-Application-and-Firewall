# Home-Lab-Web-Application-and-Firewall
This project outlines a foundational cybersecurity home lab designed to simulate a real-world scenario. A vulnerable web application is deployed and then protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF). This lab provides a practical environment for learning about common web based attacks and the defenses used to mitigate them.
